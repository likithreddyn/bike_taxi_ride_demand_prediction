# Ola Bike Ride Demand Forecasting with ML

Hello friends!

I am thrilled to share my latest mini-project: **Ola Bike Ride Demand Forecasting with ML!** 🏍📊

I built a web application using **Flask, HTML, and CSS** to predict the demand for Ola bike rides. This application aims to optimize efficient rider fleet distribution and enhance user experience by providing accurate demand forecasts. By leveraging the powerful **LightGBM** algorithm and the collaborative power of **Google Colab**, I was able to effectively analyze, normalize, and model historical ride data.

## Key Highlights

### 1. **Data Analysis and Normalization**
- Leveraged **Google Colab** for efficient data exploration and preprocessing.

### 2. **Model Building**
- Utilized the **LightGBM algorithm** for accurate demand forecasting.

### 3. **Web App Development**
- Created a **user-friendly interface** using Flask, HTML, and CSS.
- **Spyder IDE** was used to run the Flask app locally.

### 4. **Model Serialization**
- Used **Pickle** to serialize the trained model for future use and experimentation.

## Directory Structure

Your project directory should look something like this:

```
your_project_folder/
│
├── app.py               # Your main Flask app file
├── models/              # Folder where your saved model(s) are located
│   └── lgb_model.pkl    # Your trained LightGBM model file
├── templates/           # Folder containing your HTML files
│   ├── index.html       # Your main HTML file (Flask template)
│   └── results.html     # Your result card HTML file (Flask template)
├── static/              # Folder for static files like CSS, JS, images
│   └── style.css        # Your CSS file
└── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
```

---

## How It Works

1. **Input Data**: Users provide key inputs such as location, time of day, weather conditions, etc.
2. **Prediction**: The LightGBM model predicts the demand for Ola bike rides.
3. **Output**: The result is displayed on a results page, indicating the forecasted demand.

## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/bike_taxi_ride_demand_prediction.git
   cd bike_taxi_ride_demand_prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```
